# Quiz Game

This project is a simple interactive quiz game where users answer multiple-choice questions to test their knowledge. The game keeps track of the score and provides feedback on the user's performance.

## Features

- **Interactive Quiz**: Users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive immediate feedback.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the user's score and displays it at the end.
- **Play Again Option**: Users can restart the quiz after completing it.

## Getting Started

To play the Quiz Game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quiz-game
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the quiz.

## How It Works

1. **Start Quiz**: The quiz begins with the `startQuiz()` function, which initializes the game state and displays the first question.
2. **Display Questions**: Each question is shown one at a time, and users can select their answers.
3. **Answer Selection**: The `selectAnswer()` function evaluates the selected answer, updates the score, and provides visual feedback.
4. **Show Score**: After all questions have been answered, the final score is displayed.
5. **Play Again**: Users can choose to play the quiz again using the "Play Again" button.

## Customization

You can customize the quiz by modifying the `questions` array in the JavaScript file. Each question should have the following structure:

- `question`: The question text.
- `answers`: An array of possible answers, each with:
  - `text`: The answer text.
  - `correct`: A boolean indicating if the answer is correct.

## Dependencies

- **None**: This project uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with no external libraries.
